# T-2569: corpus gap: T-2557 gateway WARN misclassifies parallelGateway as unrepresentable decision

## Context

Found compiling 832's pair-draft #2 dispatch-loop.bpmn (T-2568): the Pass-4 gateway WARN (T-2557) fires on `agt_5_fan`/`agt_10_join` (parallelGateway) with the same text as exclusive gateways — "decision semantics are not representable in AEF task skeletons … surfaced here, not applied". Both clauses are wrong for parallel gateways: (a) a fork/join has NO decision semantics (all branches taken unconditionally), and (b) the parallel structure IS applied — the fork's 3 workers emit as siblings with identical `related_tasks` (same nearest-task predecessor, no cross-ordering) and the join fans all branches back into the successor's `related_tasks`. Only EXCLUSIVE gateway conditions are genuinely lossy. Also noisy: a join with a single outgoing edge WARNs about "branches" that aren't branches. Class: WARN-text/classification accuracy, sibling of the T-2557 detector itself (which stays correct for exclusiveGateway).

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
- [x] Pass-4 distinguishes gateway kinds: exclusiveGateway keeps the T-2557 decision-semantics WARN verbatim; parallelGateway emits a differently-worded note (structure IS represented via sibling related_tasks/fan-in — either an INFO-class line or a WARN that states the true semantics), never "decision semantics … not applied"
- [x] Regression test on 832's pinned dispatch-loop.bpmn asserts the exclusive WARN text unchanged (agt_4_mode) and the corrected parallel wording for agt_5_fan/agt_10_join (structure IS carried; synchronization not enforced; no 'decision semantics'/'not applied'); suite 53/53 green
- [x] 832 notified on the rail (offset 102 raised the gap + asked their W-PGW-* opinion; wording shipped in the wrap-up relay)

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.

     ── Prefix routing (T-1811, T-1878): default to [REVIEWER] if Expected is grep-able ──
     If your Expected clause is grep-able / file-exists / structural (a deterministic
     shell check), prefer [REVIEWER] — that AC should be an Agent AC with the reviewer
     command in `## Verification` instead of a Human AC here. Only keep [REVIEW] if
     verification genuinely needs human taste (tone, feel, layout rhythm).
     See CLAUDE.md §AC Classification Guidance for the conversion rule.

     [REVIEW] example (genuine human judgment):
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error

     [REVIEWER] example (static-scan-verifiable — convert to Agent AC + Verification):
       - [ ] [REVIEWER] Block message names both bypass mechanisms
         **Steps:**
         1. Run `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX`
         **Expected:** Verdict: PASS; no findings on `block-message-completeness`
         **If not:** Inspect hook block-message string and add missing mechanism
       Conversion: this AC should be moved to ### Agent and
       `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX 2>&1 | grep -q "Overall:.*PASS"` added to ## Verification.

## Verification

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# Pipefail/SIGPIPE hint (L-387): P-011 runs each command under `set -eo pipefail`.
# `cmd | grep -q PATTERN` exits 141 (SIGPIPE) when grep matches and closes stdin
# while the upstream is still writing — verification then "fails" even though
# the pattern was present. Safe pattern: capture first, grep the capture:
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"
# Or:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
# Origin: L-387, captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863) before this hint.
#
# Single pipe only — no intermediate tail/awk/sed stages between capture and grep
# (T-2090): `echo "$out" | tail -3 | grep -q PAT` re-introduces the SIGPIPE risk
# the capture step closed off — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its
# stdin on. `echo "$out"` is small and immediate; grep scans the whole captured
# string anyway, so the tail-3 was cosmetic. Drop it: `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`.
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.
python3 -m pytest tests/unit/test_bpmn_to_tasks.py -q > /tmp/.t2569-pytest.out 2>&1 && grep -q "passed" /tmp/.t2569-pytest.out
out=$(python3 tools/bpmn_to_tasks.py tests/fixtures/aef-bpmn/dispatch-loop.bpmn 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "fork/join structure IS carried"
out=$(python3 tools/bpmn_to_tasks.py tests/fixtures/aef-bpmn/dispatch-loop.bpmn 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep "agt_4_mode" | grep -q "decision semantics are not representable" 

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

### 2026-07-20 — wording states what IS carried, not just what isn't
- **What changed:** the corrected note names both halves: fork/join structure IS carried (sibling related_tasks + fan-in) AND the genuinely-lossy part (synchronization enforcement) — honest in both directions, unlike the old text which claimed total loss.
- **Plan impact:** inclusive/complex gateways deliberately stay on the T-2557 decision text (they ARE choice gateways); only parallelGateway splits.
- **Triggered:** nothing new. Implemented without waiting for 832's W-PGW vocabulary reply (their input is alignment nice-to-have, not a contract dependency; wording relayed for their reaction).

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->

## Updates

### 2026-07-19T21:41:40Z — task-created [task-create-agent]
