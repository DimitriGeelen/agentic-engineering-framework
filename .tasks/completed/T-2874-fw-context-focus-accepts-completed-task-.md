name: "fw context focus accepts completed task ids the gate then refuses — writer/reader
  scope asymmetry"
description: >
  VERIFIED IN OUR TREE (832 rail 461, G-008 upstream candidate). agents/context/lib/focus.sh:35
  validates with find_task_file "$task_id" — UNSCOPED, so it resolves active/ then
  falls back to completed/. The gate that reads the value back requires find_task_file
  "$CURRENT_TASK" active (agents/context/check-active-task.sh:401). The writer's accepted
  set is a strict superset of the reader's usable set, so every id in the difference
  writes a state that is writable but unusable: fw context focus <completed-id> exits
  0, then every gated Write/Edit/Bash dies on 'Task X is not active'. This session
  hit the resulting deadlock repeatedly after each task close. Fix is one argument
  — find_task_file "$task_id" active — plus a refusal naming the reason and the recovery
  command. 832 committed their version at 8842cedb; take as patch or re-derive. GENERALISATION
  (PL-020 widened): find_task_file's scope parameter is OPTIONAL with a permissive
  default, so omitting it is invisible at the call site — find_task_file "$id" reads
  as complete and correct in isolation. Our own T-2054 comment already says this state
  should be impossible (--status work-completed nulls current_task AND moves the file)
  but nothing enforced it on the one path that could still write it: a rule stated
  in a comment on one side of a seam is not enforced on the other. ANTI-VACUITY REQUIRED,
  and 832 named the trap: an entry leg asserting only a non-zero exit PASSES for the
  wrong reason, because 'task does not exist anywhere' exits non-zero exactly like
  'exists but is completed'. Assert message content, not rc alone. Also: P-011 runs
  probes from inside update-task.sh which has already EXPORTED PROJECT_ROOT/TASKS_DIR/CONTEXT_DIR
  for the live repo — those beat cd, so sandbox fixtures are invisible. And grep -q
  on a pattern containing \$ needs -F or the \$ is a BRE metacharacter and the match
  fails against correct code. NOTE 832 RETRACTED a second claim from their T-380:
  that the gate blocks the recovery commands it prints. Measured false — all four
  printed remedies are allowed while wedged. Do not carry that severity forward.

# T-2874: fw context focus accepts completed task ids the gate then refuses — writer/reader scope asymmetry

## Context

<!-- One sentence for small tasks. Link to design docs for substantial ones. -->

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
<!-- Criteria the agent can verify (code, tests, commands). P-010 gates on these. -->
- [x] `do_focus` validates with `find_task_file "$task_id" active` — the scope closes the
      writer/reader asymmetry at its source.
- [x] The refusal **distinguishes the two causes**. "Completed, not active" and "no such id"
      exit identically today; they need different recoveries, and "not found" sends the
      operator hunting for a typo in an id that exists.
- [x] The refusal names the recovery command (`fw work-on <id>`), per §Copy-Pasteable Commands.
- [x] ANTI-VACUITY, and the specific trap 832 named: the test asserts **message content**, not
      rc alone. An entry leg asserting only a non-zero exit **passes for the wrong reason**,
      because "does not exist anywhere" exits non-zero exactly like "exists but is completed" —
      a bare rc compare would certify this fix from a tree where the fixture never existed.
- [x] The test's fixture is genuinely visible to the code under test: `update-task.sh` exports
      `PROJECT_ROOT`/`TASKS_DIR`/`CONTEXT_DIR` for the live repo and those beat `cd`, so a
      sandbox that only changes directory is invisible and the probe answers about the wrong
      tree (832's own probe hit exactly this).
- [x] `grep` patterns containing `$` use `-F` or escape it — unescaped, `$` is a BRE
      metacharacter and the match fails against **correct** code, producing a red that sends
      the next reader to debug working software.

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.

     ── Prefix routing (T-1811, T-1878): default to [REVIEWER] if Expected is grep-able ──
     If your Expected clause is grep-able / file-exists / structural (a deterministic
     shell check), prefer [REVIEWER] — that AC should be an Agent AC with the reviewer
     command in `## Verification` instead of a Human AC here. Only keep [REVIEW] if
     verification genuinely needs human taste (tone, feel, layout rhythm).
     See CLAUDE.md §AC Classification Guidance for the conversion rule.

     [REVIEW] example (genuine human judgment):
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error

     [REVIEWER] example (static-scan-verifiable — convert to Agent AC + Verification):
       - [ ] [REVIEWER] Block message names both bypass mechanisms
         **Steps:**
         1. Run `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX`
         **Expected:** Verdict: PASS; no findings on `block-message-completeness`
         **If not:** Inspect hook block-message string and add missing mechanism
       Conversion: this AC should be moved to ### Agent and
       `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX 2>&1 | grep -q "Overall:.*PASS"` added to ## Verification.

## Verification

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# Pipefail/SIGPIPE hint (L-387): P-011 runs each command under `set -eo pipefail`.
# `cmd | grep -q PATTERN` exits 141 (SIGPIPE) when grep matches and closes stdin
# while the upstream is still writing — verification then "fails" even though
# the pattern was present. Safe pattern: capture first, grep the capture:
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"
# Or:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
# Origin: L-387, captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863) before this hint.
#
# Single pipe only — no intermediate tail/awk/sed stages between capture and grep
# (T-2090): `echo "$out" | tail -3 | grep -q PAT` re-introduces the SIGPIPE risk
# the capture step closed off — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its
# stdin on. grep scans the whole captured string anyway, so the tail-3 was
# cosmetic. Drop it: `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`.
#
# AND ONLY WHILE THE CAPTURE IS SMALL (T-2743). The two hints above are correct
# for the captures they were written about, and both invert above the pipe
# buffer. `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT` is NOT SIGPIPE-free — it is SIGPIPE-free
# only while "$out" fits in the 65536-byte pipe buffer. Above that, with an
# early match: echo blocks on the full pipe, grep -q exits, echo takes SIGPIPE,
# pipeline exits 141 under pipefail — the exact failure L-387 exists to prevent.
# Measured: a Watchtower page is 146,366 bytes, rc=141 on 3/3 runs, deterministic
# not racy. Any line that curls a rendered page is exposed (routes run 50-200KB).
# For anything that might be large, redirect to a file:
#     cmd -o /tmp/.out && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
#     curl -sf "$(bin/fw watchtower url)/page" -o /tmp/.out && grep -q "PAT" /tmp/.out
# This is the better default even when size is not a concern: `&&` keeps the
# PRODUCING command's exit code in the verdict, where `out=$(cmd)` discards it —
# the T-2738 problem one layer down. A 404 from curl fails the line instead of
# silently producing an empty capture for grep to not-match.
#
# REHEARSING A LINE BY HAND DOES NOT REHEARSE THE GATE (T-2743). Your interactive
# shell has no `set -eo pipefail`. The line above returned 0 when run by hand and
# 141 under P-011, from the same directory, the same second. To rehearse for real:
#     bash -c 'set -eo pipefail; <your verification line>'
#
# BUT NOT for a test runner (T-2738): the capture above discards the command's
# exit code, and `set -e` is suppressed inside the `if` condition the gate runs
# each line in — so in `cmd1; cmd2` only cmd2 is the verdict. For pytest/bats
# that exit code WAS the verdict, and the pass marker you grep instead survives
# a partial failure: a suite printing "3 failed, 9 passed" satisfies
# `grep -q "9 passed"`. Generalising to `grep -qE "[0-9]+ passed"` matches the
# same output. Either keep the exit code:
#     python3 -m pytest <file> -q > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q passed /tmp/.out
# or add the guard the exit code used to supply:
#     out=$(python3 -m pytest <file> -q 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q passed && ! echo "$out" | grep -q failed
#     out=$(bats <file> 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q '^ok 1 ' && ! echo "$out" | grep -q '^not ok'
# The close gate refuses the unguarded form. Bypass: FW_ALLOW_UNJUDGED_TEST_RUN=1.
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.

out=$(bats tests/unit/focus_active_scope.bats 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q '^ok 1 ' && ! echo "$out" | grep -q '^not ok'
# The teeth leg must have RUN, not skipped — a skipped anti-vacuity leg renders the
# whole suite's green meaningless and reports as "ok" either way.
out=$(bats tests/unit/focus_active_scope.bats 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q '^ok 7' && ! echo "$out" | grep -q '^ok 7.*# skip'
# The scope argument is present at the writer. -F: unescaped $ is a BRE metacharacter.
grep -qF 'find_task_file "$task_id" active' agents/context/lib/focus.sh
# Writer and reader now agree on scope — the asymmetry itself is what regressed.
grep -qF 'find_task_file "$CURRENT_TASK" active' agents/context/check-active-task.sh

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
