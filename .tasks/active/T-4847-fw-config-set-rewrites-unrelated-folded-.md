description: >
  832 field report (msg ac944d99, be.43): setting DESIGNER_FIELD_CATALOG with fw config
  set also rewrote the folded upstream_repo: line of .framework.yaml onto one line.
  Harmless in value, but it shows as a diff in a tracked file the operator did not
  intend to change. Need: fw config set changes only the key it sets and leaves every
  other line byte-identical.

# T-4847: fw config set rewrites unrelated folded lines of .framework.yaml (upstream_repo collapsed onto one line)

## Context

See description. The need: `fw config set KEY VALUE` changes the one line for KEY (or appends it) and leaves every other byte of .framework.yaml as it was: comments, key order, folded or quoted scalars, blank lines.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
- [x] Reproduce first: a bats test builds a .framework.yaml with a folded scalar (e.g. a long `upstream_repo: >-` value), a comment and a quoted value, runs `fw config set` on an unrelated key, and shows the other lines change; it fails before the fix
- [x] After the fix, setting an existing key changes only that key's line(s); setting a new key appends it; every other line is byte-identical (diff shows only the intended change)
- [x] The set value still reads back correctly through `fw config get` and lib/config.sh's resolution, including values that need YAML quoting
- [x] Existing config tests stay green (grep tests/unit for config set / fw_config) and tests/lint/config-registry-parity.bats
- [x] Vendor in sync

<!-- No Human criteria: every criterion is agent-verifiable.
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.

     ── Prefix routing (T-1811, T-1878): default to [REVIEWER] if Expected is grep-able ──
     If your Expected clause is grep-able / file-exists / structural (a deterministic
     shell check), prefer [REVIEWER] — that AC should be an Agent AC with the reviewer
     command in `## Verification` instead of a Human AC here. Only keep [REVIEW] if
     verification genuinely needs human taste (tone, feel, layout rhythm).
     See CLAUDE.md §AC Classification Guidance for the conversion rule.

     [REVIEW] example (genuine human judgment):
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error

     [REVIEWER] example (static-scan-verifiable — convert to Agent AC + Verification):
       - [ ] [REVIEWER] Block message names both bypass mechanisms
         **Steps:**
         1. Run `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX`
         **Expected:** Verdict: PASS; no findings on `block-message-completeness`
         **If not:** Inspect hook block-message string and add missing mechanism
       Conversion: this AC should be moved to ### Agent and
       `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX 2>&1 | grep -q "Overall:.*PASS"` added to ## Verification.

<!--
  Render-touching build tasks (web/templates, web/static, web/blueprints, web/shared.py,
  web/app.py …) add a section headed "Visual Verification" (level-2 heading) after
  Verification, with one checklist table — the check-visual-verification gate reads it
  at commit time (T-4213; T-4202 GO):

    | state | control | 1024 | 1440 | 1920 | note |
    |-------|---------|------|------|------|------|
    | toolbar | Load | ok | ok | ok | |

  Cells: ok / clipped / hidden / overlap / unreachable (non-ok needs a note). Each
  listed state needs screenshots at every UX_SHOT_WIDTHS width:
  fw ux shots <T-ID> <state>=<URL>. This comment is inert: the gate ignores it.

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
# Build/refactor/decommission tasks with NO command here are refused. If nothing can be
# run, add the line `# verification: none — <why nothing can be run>`; it is serviced
# (queued for review: add a check / other evidence / accept). See docs/reports/T-4024-servicing-loop.md.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# ── Mutable-corpus anchor (T-3326) ────────────────────────────────────────────
# Do NOT anchor a verification line (or a unit test it runs) to MUTABLE corpus
# state — an exact live count, or a grep of live `fw audit`/`fw doctor` output
# for a specific corpus entity (a named arc, a task count, a census number).
# The corpus moves under the check, and the line rots: it goes red (or vanishes
# its pattern) for reasons unrelated to the code under test, blocking closes.
# Pin the INVARIANT (categories sum, count > 0, property holds) or run the code
# against a COMMITTED FIXTURE — never the live count or a live-audit line.
# Origin: T-2969 line grepping live audit for one arc's status; T-2871's census
# test pinning exact live counts (56→74 files) — both blocked closes (OBS-377).
#
# ── Pipefail/SIGPIPE: grepping a command's output (L-387, T-2090, T-2743, T-2738) ──
#
# THE DEFAULT — redirect to a file, then grep the file:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
#     curl -sf "$(bin/fw watchtower url)/page" -o /tmp/.out && grep -q "PAT" /tmp/.out
# Correct at any output size, and `&&` keeps the PRODUCING command's exit code in
# the verdict. Reach for this first; the alternative below is the special case.
#
# Why not `cmd | grep -q PAT` (L-387): P-011 runs each line with PIPEFAIL LIVE
# (errexit is not — see below). When grep matches it exits and closes stdin while cmd is still
# writing, cmd takes SIGPIPE, the pipeline exits 141 — verification "fails" with
# the pattern present. Captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863).
#
# THE EXCEPTION — capture first, grep the capture:
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"
# Valid ONLY while "$out" fits the 65536-byte pipe buffer, and it is on you to
# know that it does. Above that the form inverts and becomes the very failure
# L-387 describes: echo blocks on the full pipe, grep -q exits, echo takes
# SIGPIPE, rc=141 (T-2743 — measured on a 146,366-byte Watchtower page, 3/3 runs,
# deterministic not racy; rendered routes run 50-200KB, so anything that curls a
# page is over the line). It also discards cmd's exit code, so a 404 yields an
# empty capture that grep merely fails to match rather than a failed line.
# If you do use it: single pipe only, no intermediate tail/awk/sed stage between
# capture and grep (T-2090) — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its stdin
# on, and grep scans the whole captured string anyway, so the `tail -3` was
# cosmetic. `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`, nothing between.
#
# TEST RUNNERS need a guard either way (T-2738). `set -e` is suppressed inside the
# `if` condition the gate runs each line in, so in `cmd1; cmd2` only cmd2 is the
# verdict — and the pass marker you grep for survives a partial failure: a suite
# printing "3 failed, 9 passed" satisfies `grep -q "9 passed"`, and generalising
# to `grep -qE "[0-9]+ passed"` matches the same output. Keep the exit code:
#     python3 -m pytest <file> -q > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q passed /tmp/.out
# or add the guard the exit code used to supply:
#     out=$(python3 -m pytest <file> -q 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q passed && ! echo "$out" | grep -q failed
#     out=$(bats <file> 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q '^ok 1 ' && ! echo "$out" | grep -q '^not ok'
# The close gate refuses the unguarded form. Bypass: FW_ALLOW_UNJUDGED_TEST_RUN=1.
#
# ── A SKIPPED BATS TEST REPORTS `ok` (T-3217) ─────────────────────────────────
#
# `! grep -q "^not ok"` does NOT mean the suite ran. Bats emits a skip as
#     ok 6 <name> # skip <reason>
# which is not a `not ok`, so the gate passes and the report says ok while the
# thing the test covers was measured NOWHERE. Origin: T-3213 guarded a test with
# `[ "$(id -u)" -eq 0 ] && skip` — the suite runs as root here and in CI, so it
# skipped on every run that mattered, for as long as it existed.
#
# Add a skip clause to any bats verification line. `# skip` is the marker bats
# writes; counting it is the whole check:
#     timeout 300 bats <file> > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && ! grep -q "^not ok" /tmp/.out
#     test "$(grep -c '# skip' /tmp/.out)" -eq 0
# Two lines, because they answer different questions — "did anything fail" and
# "did everything run". If some skips are legitimate on your host (an optional
# dependency is genuinely absent), assert the COUNT you expect rather than zero,
# and say in the task why that number is right.
#
# Corpus-wide, the same check runs from `bin/fw test lint`
# (tools/bats-silent-skip-lint.py): static mode flags guards that are fixed for
# a deployment rather than probing an optional dependency, and `--tap FILE`
# reports the skips a real run actually fired.
#
# REHEARSING A LINE BY HAND DOES NOT REHEARSE THE GATE (T-2743). Your interactive
# shell has no pipefail. A line has returned 0 by hand and 141 under P-011, from
# the same directory, the same second. To rehearse for real:
#     bash -c 'set -o pipefail; <your verification line>'
#
# NOTE THE MISSING `-e` — it is not a typo (T-3203). This file used to prescribe
# `set -eo pipefail` here, which is NOT the gate: it adds errexit the gate does
# not have, so it FAILS lines the gate PASSES. Measured, 10 lines, 3 diverged:
#     line                            gate    set -eo (old)   set -o (this)
#     false; true                     PASS    FAIL  wrong     PASS  ok
#     cd /nonexistent; echo ok        PASS    FAIL  wrong     PASS  ok
#     grep -q MISS file; true         PASS    FAIL  wrong     PASS  ok
# The divergence is one-directional and that is the trap: the old rehearsal only
# ever fails lines the gate accepts, so it produces false REDS, and an author
# who "fixes" a line to satisfy it is fixing something that was never broken —
# while the line that actually is broken (`cmd1; cmd2` where cmd1 fails) passes
# both. Re-derive rather than trust this table — it is pinned, not asserted:
#     bats tests/unit/t3203_p011_gate_semantics.bats
#
# ── `cmd1; cmd2` IS JUDGED ONLY ON cmd2 (T-3203) ──────────────────────────────
#
# The gate runs each line as the CONDITION of an `if` (update-task.sh:1215), and
# POSIX suppresses errexit for a compound command in an `if` condition — through
# the subshell. So pipefail applies and `set -e` does not, and in a sequence only
# the LAST command's status reaches the verdict. `cd /nonexistent; echo ok` passes.
# 2,644 of 10,997 verification lines in this corpus contain `;` (re-derive with
# the query in docs/reports/T-3203-p011-gate-semantics.md).
#
# SAFE SHAPES — both verified biting, each against a passing control:
#   A. one command whose own status is the verdict (prefer this):
#        out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q PAT && ! echo "$out" | grep -q BAD
#      the leading assignments are setup; the trailing `&&` chain is the verdict.
#   B. an explicit sub-shell, whose errexit the outer `if` cannot reach into:
#        bash -c 'set -eo pipefail; cmd1; cmd2'
#      use when you genuinely need every command in the sequence to count.
#
# The rule of thumb: put the assertion LAST, and make sure it is an assertion.
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.
#
# Vendored-path hint (T-3236, T-4419): if you edited bin/fw, lib/, agents/, policy/,
# web/, tools/ or .tasks/templates/, run `bin/fw vendor self` and add
#     bin/fw vendor self --check --task T-XXXX
# (your own task id). It checks only the files your commits changed, so another
# worker's uncommitted edit does not block your close; that drift is listed as
# "in flight, not this task". The whole-tree `--check` stays for audit/pre-push.

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

**Symptom:** `fw config set DESIGNER_FIELD_CATALOG …` on 832 also rewrote the `upstream_repo:` line of `.framework.yaml`, joining its continuation line onto the key line — a diff in a tracked file the operator never meant to touch.

**Root cause:** `lib/config-file.sh` `_config_set` (the PYSET heredoc) loaded the whole file with ruamel.yaml and re-dumped it with `width = 4096` (T-3735). ruamel round-trips comments and block scalars (`>-`, `|`) but not a plain scalar wrapped onto an indented continuation line: it reads it as one string and dumps it on one line. So every `set` normalised every such line in the file, whatever the key. Reproduced in `tests/unit/t4847_config_set_preserves_lines.bats` (7/9 red against the old code).

**Why structurally allowed:** the existing config tests (`lib_config_file.bats`, `t3924_config_key_case.bats`) asserted that the target key was written and read back, never that the rest of the file was unchanged; their fixtures were two short lines with nothing for a re-dump to change. T-3735 widened the dump on purpose so long values stay on the key line, which made the collapse look intended.

**Prevention:** the new bats file diffs the whole file before and after `set` on a fixture with a wrapped plain scalar, a `>-` block, comments, a quoted value and a nested map, and requires the diff to be exactly the target key's lines. Flat keys are now edited in place, so a re-dump never touches them.

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Recommendation

<!-- T-2945: same shape as inception.md's block — the gate that reads it
     (audit_inception_recommendation, lib/task-audit.sh:117) is shared, so the
     shape is copied rather than reinvented.

     REQUIRED once this task reaches partial-complete: Agent ACs done, at least
     one `### Human` AC still unticked. `lib/review.sh:205-211` (T-2421) BLOCKS
     `fw task review` emission for build/refactor/test/decommission tasks in that
     state with no substantive block here — the operator would otherwise open
     /review/<id> to a blank Recommendation card and be asked to approve a form.

     Not required while every Human AC is ticked or the task has none: the gate
     only fires on the partial-complete transition. It is here from the start so
     you write it while you still have the evidence, not when the gate refuses.

     Format (the parser wants the `**Recommendation:**` line at the start of a
     line; a leading `-` or `*` bullet is also accepted):
     **Recommendation:** GO / NO-GO / DEFER
     **Rationale:** Why (cite evidence — what shipped, what was proven, what remains)
     **Evidence:**
     - Finding 1
     - Finding 2

     DEFER is for evidence gaps, not confidence gaps (CLAUDE.md §Presenting Work
     for Human Review). If the artefact is complete and you still don't want to
     commit, that is a calibration failure — recommend GO or NO-GO.

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.

### 2026-10-27 — how to stop set from rewriting other lines
- **Chose:** edit flat (top-level) keys line by line: replace the key line plus its continuation lines (indented, blank, or top-level `- ` items; trailing blank/comment lines left in place), or append one line. The value is rendered with `yaml.safe_dump({key: value})` so quoting is correct. Dotted keys keep the ruamel round-trip.
- **Why:** every key `fw config set` writes in practice is flat; a line edit is the only way to promise byte-identical other lines. safe_dump quotes only what needs it, and the result reads back through both the grep reader in `lib/config.sh` and `yaml.safe_load`.
- **Rejected:** tuning ruamel (it cannot round-trip a wrapped plain scalar); rewriting nested keys line-wise too (needs a YAML-aware editor; the nested path is rare and was not reported).

### 2026-10-27 — parent review: the T-3735 heal-on-write is gone (accepted, follow-up filed)
- **Found:** before this change every `fw config set` re-dumped the file at width 4096 (T-3735), which as a side effect unfolded an `upstream_repo` folded by an older `set`. That unfolding is what 832 saw as the "rewrite". The line-wise edit never folds anything, but it also no longer heals a file that is still folded, and `lib/update.sh` reads a folded `upstream_repo` as empty.
- **Chose:** keep the line-wise edit (832's need: set changes only its own key) and fix the reader instead, as its own task, so a folded value reads correctly however it got there. The parent also updated `tests/unit/t3735_config_set_no_fold.bats` test 2, which asserted the fallback dumper's warning on a flat key: it now drives the fallback through a dotted key and still checks the long value on a flat set.

### 2026-10-27 — inline comment on the replaced key line
- **Chose:** drop it; the whole key line is replaced.
- **Why:** the grep reader in `lib/config.sh` `_fw_config_file_val` does not strip `# comment`, so a kept comment would be read as part of the value (`3009   # c`). Replacing the line means `fw_config` reads what was set.

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
