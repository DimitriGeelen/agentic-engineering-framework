# T-3014: T-3005 slice 5: scheduled incremental reindex

## Context

Slice 5 of T-3005, and the one that makes slices 2–4 mean something. The index is
157.6 days old; T-3012 made that visible and T-3013 made it watched, but nothing
rebuilds it — so the canary has never been green on real data, only on fixtures.

Design constraint carried in from T-3010: the corpus is 393,082 chunks, 13.7× the
~21k the original research assumed. A full rebuild is an hours-long job, so this
must be incremental or the schedule cannot hold.

Ordering note to settle before building: T-3007 step B (choosing the target
embedding model) changes `EMBEDDING_DIM` and the vec0 schema. If that lands first,
the reindex here should be the *same operation* as the model switch rather than a
second full pass.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
<!-- Criteria the agent can verify (code, tests, commands). P-010 gates on these. -->
- [ ] A reindex runs on a schedule and the canary goes from `unknown` to `ok` — the
      first time the T-3011 canaries are seen green on real data rather than on a
      fixture. Until this ships, slices 2-4 watch something nobody rebuilds.
- [x] The cron entry follows the L-364 chain (registry → generate → install) and
      `## Verification` carries the in-sync + not-drifted assertion.
- [x] Reindex is incremental, not a full 393,082-chunk rebuild per run. A full build
      is hours; a schedule that cannot finish between firings is not a schedule.
- [x] Concurrent runs cannot overlap (flock, as the other audit crons do), and a run
      that dies mid-way leaves the previous index serving rather than a half-built one.
      The manifest is written last, so a partial build reads as the *old* build's
      manifest — never as a fresh one.
- [ ] `fw doctor` shows the age dropping after a run, verified by observing the number
      before and after — not by asserting the job exited 0.
- [x] RED observed first: exercised against a deliberately stale index to confirm the
      age changes, and against a run killed mid-way to confirm the manifest did not
      advance.

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.

     ── Prefix routing (T-1811, T-1878): default to [REVIEWER] if Expected is grep-able ──
     If your Expected clause is grep-able / file-exists / structural (a deterministic
     shell check), prefer [REVIEWER] — that AC should be an Agent AC with the reviewer
     command in `## Verification` instead of a Human AC here. Only keep [REVIEW] if
     verification genuinely needs human taste (tone, feel, layout rhythm).
     See CLAUDE.md §AC Classification Guidance for the conversion rule.

     [REVIEW] example (genuine human judgment):
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error

     [REVIEWER] example (static-scan-verifiable — convert to Agent AC + Verification):
       - [ ] [REVIEWER] Block message names both bypass mechanisms
         **Steps:**
         1. Run `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX`
         **Expected:** Verdict: PASS; no findings on `block-message-completeness`
         **If not:** Inspect hook block-message string and add missing mechanism
       Conversion: this AC should be moved to ### Agent and
       `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX 2>&1 | grep -q "Overall:.*PASS"` added to ## Verification.
-->

## Decisions

### 2026-08-15 — where concurrency protection lives
- **Chose:** own it inside `reindex_incremental()` — advisory flock, per-process
  scratch name, inode identity check before the swap
- **Why:** AC4 said "flock, as the other audit crons do", which put the guard on
  the cron line. That serialises cron against cron and nothing else. The first
  real run was destroyed inside 25 minutes by a non-cron actor, with
  `/proc/<pid>/fd/3` reading `(deleted)` while the process kept embedding.
- **Rejected:** leaving it to callers — a guarantee every caller must remember
  to wrap is not a guarantee

### 2026-08-15 — checkpoint granularity
- **Chose:** flush every ~512 accumulated chunks, on file boundaries
- **Why:** measured 1.9 chunks/s against the live embed host, 394,230 chunks in
  the corpus — a ~29-58h bootstrap. Non-resumable, an hourly cron can never
  finish it: every firing restarts from zero and the canary stays `unknown`
  forever while each run looks correct. Committing per group makes progress
  durable so successive firings chip away. Bounding by chunks rather than files
  keeps the interval between durable points predictable (a 40-file group
  measured ~15 min).
- **Rejected:** checkpointing mid-file — file_state is what a resumed run trusts
  to skip work, so a file marked done without its rows would be skipped forever
  and the gap would be invisible

## Status (2026-08-15)

Mechanism complete and tested: 19 tests here, 58 across the vector-index suites,
with the swap guard and the resume guarantee both mutation-tested (red when the
guard is disabled, green when restored).

AC1 (canary `unknown` -> `ok`) and AC5 (doctor age drops) are **not met** and
cannot be met from this session:

1. The bootstrap is ~29-58h of embedding at the measured rate. Resumability now
   lets it proceed across cron firings rather than restarting, but it is still
   ~29h of wall-clock before the first green canary.
2. The embed sidecar on 127.0.0.1:11435 went down mid-run and nothing restarts
   it — no systemd unit, no docker, no documented launch parameters anywhere in
   the repo (OBS-259). Every embedding path is down until it is restarted by
   hand.

Partial work is parked at `.context/working/fw-vec-index.db.reindex.resume` and
will be adopted by the next run. The live index is untouched throughout —
verified by inode, still 21,292 docs at its March mtime.

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# ── Pipefail/SIGPIPE: grepping a command's output (L-387, T-2090, T-2743, T-2738) ──
#
# THE DEFAULT — redirect to a file, then grep the file:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
#     curl -sf "$(bin/fw watchtower url)/page" -o /tmp/.out && grep -q "PAT" /tmp/.out
# Correct at any output size, and `&&` keeps the PRODUCING command's exit code in
# the verdict. Reach for this first; the alternative below is the special case.
#
# Why not `cmd | grep -q PAT` (L-387): P-011 runs each line under `set -eo
# pipefail`. When grep matches it exits and closes stdin while cmd is still
# writing, cmd takes SIGPIPE, the pipeline exits 141 — verification "fails" with
# the pattern present. Captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863).
#
# THE EXCEPTION — capture first, grep the capture:
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"
# Valid ONLY while "$out" fits the 65536-byte pipe buffer, and it is on you to
# know that it does. Above that the form inverts and becomes the very failure
# L-387 describes: echo blocks on the full pipe, grep -q exits, echo takes
# SIGPIPE, rc=141 (T-2743 — measured on a 146,366-byte Watchtower page, 3/3 runs,
# deterministic not racy; rendered routes run 50-200KB, so anything that curls a
# page is over the line). It also discards cmd's exit code, so a 404 yields an
# empty capture that grep merely fails to match rather than a failed line.
# If you do use it: single pipe only, no intermediate tail/awk/sed stage between
# capture and grep (T-2090) — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its stdin
# on, and grep scans the whole captured string anyway, so the `tail -3` was
# cosmetic. `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`, nothing between.
#
# TEST RUNNERS need a guard either way (T-2738). `set -e` is suppressed inside the
# `if` condition the gate runs each line in, so in `cmd1; cmd2` only cmd2 is the
# verdict — and the pass marker you grep for survives a partial failure: a suite
# printing "3 failed, 9 passed" satisfies `grep -q "9 passed"`, and generalising
# to `grep -qE "[0-9]+ passed"` matches the same output. Keep the exit code:
#     python3 -m pytest <file> -q > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q passed /tmp/.out
# or add the guard the exit code used to supply:
#     out=$(python3 -m pytest <file> -q 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q passed && ! echo "$out" | grep -q failed
#     out=$(bats <file> 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q '^ok 1 ' && ! echo "$out" | grep -q '^not ok'
# The close gate refuses the unguarded form. Bypass: FW_ALLOW_UNJUDGED_TEST_RUN=1.
#
# REHEARSING A LINE BY HAND DOES NOT REHEARSE THE GATE (T-2743). Your interactive
# shell has no `set -eo pipefail`. A line has returned 0 by hand and 141 under
# P-011, from the same directory, the same second. To rehearse for real:
#     bash -c 'set -eo pipefail; <your verification line>'
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Recommendation

<!-- T-2945: same shape as inception.md's block — the gate that reads it
     (audit_inception_recommendation, lib/task-audit.sh:117) is shared, so the
     shape is copied rather than reinvented.

     REQUIRED once this task reaches partial-complete: Agent ACs done, at least
     one `### Human` AC still unticked. `lib/review.sh:205-211` (T-2421) BLOCKS
     `fw task review` emission for build/refactor/test/decommission tasks in that
     state with no substantive block here — the operator would otherwise open
     /review/<id> to a blank Recommendation card and be asked to approve a form.

     Not required while every Human AC is ticked or the task has none: the gate
     only fires on the partial-complete transition. It is here from the start so
     you write it while you still have the evidence, not when the gate refuses.

     Format (the parser wants the `**Recommendation:**` line at the start of a
     line; a leading `-` or `*` bullet is also accepted):
     **Recommendation:** GO / NO-GO / DEFER
     **Rationale:** Why (cite evidence — what shipped, what was proven, what remains)
     **Evidence:**
     - Finding 1
     - Finding 2

     DEFER is for evidence gaps, not confidence gaps (CLAUDE.md §Presenting Work
     for Human Review). If the artefact is complete and you still don't want to
     commit, that is a calibration failure — recommend GO or NO-GO.
-->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
