name: "Should continuous-driver carry a non-termlink transport leg for TUI targets?"
description: >
  G-097 shows termlink inject silently no-ops into a claude TUI while tmux send-keys works. Decide whether the framework's continuous-driver should carry a tmux send-keys fallback leg, or wait for the upstream TermLink fix and keep a single named transport.

  `inject`/`pty inject` against ink-based raw-mode TUIs, or (b) T-3275 closed, which converts an
  undelivered tick from a false 'injected' ledger entry into a loud refusal and removes the harm
  that made a second transport urgent. Whichever lands first is enough to decide."

# T-3276: Should continuous-driver carry a non-termlink transport leg for TUI targets?

## Problem Statement

<!-- What problem are we exploring? For whom? Why now? -->

## Assumptions

<!-- Key assumptions to test. Register with: fw assumption add "Statement" --task T-XXX -->

## Open Questions

<!-- T-2190 (T-2186 Slice 4): every IW-N question must be disposed before
     --status work-completed. Disposition gate (agents/task-create/update-task.sh
     check_disposition_gate) refuses on under-disposed inceptions.

     Per-question shape:

       - **IW-1: <question text>**
         confidence: 0-3      (your confidence in your current answer; 0=guess, 3=verified)
         disposition: answered | deferred | dissolved
         rationale: <one-line evidence — file:line, decision id, dialogue ref>

     Never bare yes/no — the gate refuses bare checkboxes. See 050-Inceptions.md
     §Disposition Gate. Bypass: --skip-disposition-gate "rationale" (direct) or
     FW_SKIP_DISPOSITION_GATE=1 (env-var, T-1890 producer/consumer parity).
-->

## Exploration Plan

<!-- How will we validate assumptions? Spikes, prototypes, research? Time-box each. -->

## Technical Constraints

<!-- What platform, browser, network, or hardware constraints apply?
     For web apps: HTTPS requirements, browser API restrictions, CORS, device support.
     For hardware APIs (mic, camera, GPS, Bluetooth): access requirements, permissions model.
     For infrastructure: network topology, firewall rules, latency bounds.
     Fill this BEFORE building. Discovering constraints after implementation wastes sessions. -->

## Scope Fence

<!-- What's IN scope for this exploration? What's explicitly OUT? -->

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
<!-- @auto-tick-on-decide -->
- [ ] Problem statement validated
<!-- @auto-tick-on-decide -->
- [ ] Assumptions tested
<!-- @auto-tick-on-decide -->
- [ ] Recommendation written with rationale

### Human
<!-- @auto-tick-on-decide -->
- [ ] [REVIEW] Review exploration findings and approve go/no-go decision
  **Steps:**
  1. Run: `fw task review T-XXX` (opens Watchtower with recommendation, assumptions, research artifacts)
  2. Review the Agent Recommendation section and go/no-go criteria evaluation
  3. Record decision via the Watchtower form or the command shown alongside the QR code
  **Expected:** Decision recorded, task completed
  **If not:** Ask agent for clarification on specific findings

## Go/No-Go Criteria

<!-- Fill these BEFORE writing the recommendation. The placeholder detector will block review/decide if left empty. -->
**GO if:**
- Root cause identified with bounded fix path
- Fix is scoped, testable, and reversible

**NO-GO if:**
- Problem requires fundamental redesign or unbounded scope
- Fix cost exceeds benefit given current evidence

## Verification

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# For inception tasks, verification is often not needed (decisions, not code).
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if a GO decision will mean editing *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml,
# *.go, Cargo.toml, tsconfig.json, or pom.xml in the build task, plan to add the
# matching build command (dotnet build / go build / cargo check / tsc --noEmit /
# mvn compile) to that build task's ## Verification — P-011 only runs what you write.

## Recommendation

**Recommendation:** DEFER

**Rationale:** Genuine external dependency, not a confidence hedge: the fix for G-097 is homed at TermLink (Gap Homing, T-1333) and T-3256 — the product-feedback task that would elicit their answer — is still 'captured' and owner:human, so no upstream signal exists yet to decide against. The local evidence is already complete and points AWAY from urgency rather than toward it: tmux send-keys is a measured-working transport into a claude TUI (T-3255 control, succeeded 2/2 where termlink failed 2/2), so a fallback is known-feasible; and once T-3275 lands delivery confirmation, an undelivered tick becomes a loud refusal rather than a false 'injected' ledger entry, which removes the harm that made this urgent. Revisit when either TermLink responds to T-3256 or T-3275 closes — whichever first.
