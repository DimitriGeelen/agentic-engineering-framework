# T-2430: Audit WARN — Fabric: 97/836 cards have no edges
## Trigger

Audit run: 2026-07-02T18:32:53Z
Finding: Fabric: 97/836 cards have no edges

## Finding

```
Fabric: 97/836 cards have no edges
```

Mitigation: Run: fw fabric enrich

## RCA

**Symptom:** (TBD — fill during investigation)

**Root cause:** (TBD — structural? env? config? transient?)

**Why structurally allowed:** (TBD)

**Prevention:** (TBD)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
- [ ] Root cause identified and documented in RCA section
- [ ] Fix implemented (or determination that finding is false positive / transient)
- [ ] Re-run audit shows finding absent

## Verification

# Re-run audit - finding should be absent
bin/fw audit 2>&1 | grep -q "Fabric: 97/836 cards have no edges" && exit 1 || exit 0
