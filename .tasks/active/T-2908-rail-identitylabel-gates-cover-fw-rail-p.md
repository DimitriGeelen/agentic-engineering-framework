# T-2908: rail identity+label gates cover fw rail post only — the MCP producer surface is unguarded

## Context

T-2904 shipped a gate refusing host-signed rail posts; T-2905 shipped an emitted
`from_project` label. Rail 513 reported the class closed. **It is closed on one
producer leg.** Both gates live in `do_rail post` in `bin/fw`. The
`mcp__termlink__termlink_channel_post` MCP tool is a second producer that reaches the
same topic with neither gate in scope — no identity check, no label attach.

Found by reading 832's rail 514 §4, where they declared the same asymmetry on their
side (their MCP posts carry `from_project` because a human types it into the metadata
map; their detector catches a miss only afterwards as UNATTRIBUTED). Going to check
whether ours was better is what surfaced that it is not. Not found by review — our own
L-399 / T-1890 discipline says a bypass contract must be honoured by every command
pattern the gate covers, and that discipline was cited in the same session that
shipped the one-leg gate.

### Measured, not inferred (2026-08-10)

Posted rail 515 through the MCP surface and read the envelope back:

| surface | `sender_id` | key | gated by T-2904/T-2905 |
|---------|-------------|-----|------------------------|
| `fw rail post` / shell `termlink channel post` | `d1993c2c3ec44c94` | substrate, shared with 832 | yes |
| `mcp__termlink__termlink_channel_post` | `0e7ee6cad65137fc` | **AEF project key** | **no** |
| 832's MCP surface (rail 514, for comparison) | `6a646ce8b1bc6560` | 832 project key | n/a |

**The split is by surface, and it inverts the gate.** MCP loads a project identity;
shell inherits the substrate's. So the surface with the *correct* identity is the
ungated one, and the gated one is the one that can only sign as the substrate. Rail
510 and 513 were sent host-signed via a logged Tier-2 bypass of our own gate — that
bypass was unnecessary. The right identity was available the whole time on a surface
nobody had measured.

**This also collapses part of T-2904's open question.** That task left "which
fingerprint do we adopt" with the operator, framing it as mint-a-new-key versus
find-a-file-behind-the-T-559-fence. Neither is needed to *have* a project identity:
`0e7ee6ca` exists, is loaded, and is already the key the DM topic name was built from
(`dm:0e7ee6ca…:6a646ce8…`). The remaining operator question is narrower — whether the
shell surface should be made to load it too.

Prediction discipline: the consequence above was posted to 832 in rail 515 **before**
the envelope was read, so it is on the record either way. It held.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
<!-- Criteria the agent can verify (code, tests, commands). P-010 gates on these. -->
- [ ] Every producer surface that can post to a rail topic from this project is
      enumerated — `fw rail post`, bare `termlink channel post`, the
      `mcp__termlink__termlink_channel_post` MCP tool, and anything in the repo
      that shells out to any of them — with each marked gated or ungated. The
      enumeration is the deliverable: T-2904/T-2905 shipped believing there was
      one producer, and 513 reported the class closed on that belief
- [ ] The signing identity of each surface is MEASURED, one post per surface with
      the observed `sender_id` recorded — not inferred from the tool's docs. The
      prior round's wrong conclusion came from reasoning about a surface instead
      of posting from it
- [ ] Whether the MCP surface CAN be gated is answered concretely. It is provided
      by termlink, not by us, and a PreToolUse hook is the only interposition
      point we own. If prevention is not reachable, say so plainly and state what
      detection replaces it — "detection, not prevention" recorded as such rather
      than described as a fix (832's own §4 is the standard to match here)
- [ ] L-399 parity is re-checked across every gated surface: the documented bypass
      mechanism actually works on each one, or the block message names the
      surfaces it cannot reach. A contract honoured on one leg is the T-1890
      failure, and this task exists because that happened again
- [ ] If a guard ships, it goes RED against the pre-fix state — an ungated post
      demonstrably reaching the topic — not merely green afterwards

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.

     ── Prefix routing (T-1811, T-1878): default to [REVIEWER] if Expected is grep-able ──
     If your Expected clause is grep-able / file-exists / structural (a deterministic
     shell check), prefer [REVIEWER] — that AC should be an Agent AC with the reviewer
     command in `## Verification` instead of a Human AC here. Only keep [REVIEW] if
     verification genuinely needs human taste (tone, feel, layout rhythm).
     See CLAUDE.md §AC Classification Guidance for the conversion rule.

     [REVIEW] example (genuine human judgment):
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error

     [REVIEWER] example (static-scan-verifiable — convert to Agent AC + Verification):
       - [ ] [REVIEWER] Block message names both bypass mechanisms
         **Steps:**
         1. Run `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX`
         **Expected:** Verdict: PASS; no findings on `block-message-completeness`
         **If not:** Inspect hook block-message string and add missing mechanism
       Conversion: this AC should be moved to ### Agent and
       `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX 2>&1 | grep -q "Overall:.*PASS"` added to ## Verification.

## Verification

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# Pipefail/SIGPIPE hint (L-387): P-011 runs each command under `set -eo pipefail`.
# `cmd | grep -q PATTERN` exits 141 (SIGPIPE) when grep matches and closes stdin
# while the upstream is still writing — verification then "fails" even though
# the pattern was present. Safe pattern: capture first, grep the capture:
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"
# Or:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
# Origin: L-387, captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863) before this hint.
#
# Single pipe only — no intermediate tail/awk/sed stages between capture and grep
# (T-2090): `echo "$out" | tail -3 | grep -q PAT` re-introduces the SIGPIPE risk
# the capture step closed off — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its
# stdin on. grep scans the whole captured string anyway, so the tail-3 was
# cosmetic. Drop it: `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`.
#
# AND ONLY WHILE THE CAPTURE IS SMALL (T-2743). The two hints above are correct
# for the captures they were written about, and both invert above the pipe
# buffer. `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT` is NOT SIGPIPE-free — it is SIGPIPE-free
# only while "$out" fits in the 65536-byte pipe buffer. Above that, with an
# early match: echo blocks on the full pipe, grep -q exits, echo takes SIGPIPE,
# pipeline exits 141 under pipefail — the exact failure L-387 exists to prevent.
# Measured: a Watchtower page is 146,366 bytes, rc=141 on 3/3 runs, deterministic
# not racy. Any line that curls a rendered page is exposed (routes run 50-200KB).
# For anything that might be large, redirect to a file:
#     cmd -o /tmp/.out && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
#     curl -sf "$(bin/fw watchtower url)/page" -o /tmp/.out && grep -q "PAT" /tmp/.out
# This is the better default even when size is not a concern: `&&` keeps the
# PRODUCING command's exit code in the verdict, where `out=$(cmd)` discards it —
# the T-2738 problem one layer down. A 404 from curl fails the line instead of
# silently producing an empty capture for grep to not-match.
#
# REHEARSING A LINE BY HAND DOES NOT REHEARSE THE GATE (T-2743). Your interactive
# shell has no `set -eo pipefail`. The line above returned 0 when run by hand and
# 141 under P-011, from the same directory, the same second. To rehearse for real:
#     bash -c 'set -eo pipefail; <your verification line>'
#
# BUT NOT for a test runner (T-2738): the capture above discards the command's
# exit code, and `set -e` is suppressed inside the `if` condition the gate runs
# each line in — so in `cmd1; cmd2` only cmd2 is the verdict. For pytest/bats
# that exit code WAS the verdict, and the pass marker you grep instead survives
# a partial failure: a suite printing "3 failed, 9 passed" satisfies
# `grep -q "9 passed"`. Generalising to `grep -qE "[0-9]+ passed"` matches the
# same output. Either keep the exit code:
#     python3 -m pytest <file> -q > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q passed /tmp/.out
# or add the guard the exit code used to supply:
#     out=$(python3 -m pytest <file> -q 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q passed && ! echo "$out" | grep -q failed
#     out=$(bats <file> 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q '^ok 1 ' && ! echo "$out" | grep -q '^not ok'
# The close gate refuses the unguarded form. Bypass: FW_ALLOW_UNJUDGED_TEST_RUN=1.
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
