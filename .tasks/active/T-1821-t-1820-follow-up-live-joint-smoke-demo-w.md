name: "T-1820 follow-up: live joint-smoke demo when TermLink wires aggregator handler
  at hub startup"
description: >
  T-1820 partial-shipped substrate (deploy + framework subscriber operational). Headline
  mechanic (live binary-to-binary observation of inbox.queued) NOT yet demonstrated
  — three CLI posts to inbox:<id> with file.init produced no event. Working hypothesis:
  the handler that injects inbox.queued into the aggregator runs inside the integration
  test (via init_aggregator), not at hub startup. Needs TermLink-side fix (wire init_aggregator
  at hub boot OR add a CLI command that triggers the existing path). When TermLink
  resolves, re-run the smoke against the live hub: spawn consumer, drive the trigger,
  observe event on framework subscriber, capture transcript, file demo artefact. Related:

# T-1821: T-1820 follow-up: live joint-smoke demo when TermLink wires aggregator handler at hub startup

## Context

**Superseded premise (2026-08-11):** this task's title and description assume
the aggregator handler is "not wired at hub startup." A live rerun of T-1820's
joint smoke on 2026-08-11 disproved that hypothesis directly (the aggregator
is wired at hub boot — `crates/termlink-hub/src/server.rs:279`) and found
the real, conclusive root cause: `lib/peer.py::poll_once` polls a
per-session event bus, which structurally cannot see hub-aggregator-injected
events, plus a topic-name mismatch (`dm.queued` vs `inbox.queued`) on the DM
rail. Full reproduction trail: `docs/reports/T-1820-joint-smoke-demo.md`
§"2026-08-11 — conclusive rerun". **Follow-up work is now tracked in T-2918**
(fixes `lib/peer.py` + resolves the topic question + reruns this smoke).
Recommend closing this task as superseded by T-2918 rather than duplicating
scope, pending operator confirmation.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
<!-- Criteria the agent can verify (code, tests, commands). P-010 gates on these. -->
- [ ] [First criterion]
- [ ] [Second criterion]

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.
     Optionally prefix with [RUBBER-STAMP] or [REVIEW] for prioritization.
     Example:
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error
-->

## Verification

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->
