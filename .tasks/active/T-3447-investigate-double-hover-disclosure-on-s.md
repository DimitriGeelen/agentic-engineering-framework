# T-3447: Investigate double-hover disclosure on struktur.html entity rows

## Problem Statement

<!-- What problem are we exploring? For whom? Why now? -->

## Assumptions

<!-- Key assumptions to test. Register with: fw assumption add "Statement" --task T-XXX -->

## Open Questions

<!-- T-2190 (T-2186 Slice 4): every IW-N question must be disposed before
     --status work-completed. Disposition gate (agents/task-create/update-task.sh
     check_disposition_gate) refuses on under-disposed inceptions.

     Per-question shape:

       - **IW-1: <question text>**
         confidence: 0-3      (your confidence in your current answer; 0=guess, 3=verified)
         disposition: answered | deferred | dissolved
         rationale: <one-line evidence — file:line, decision id, dialogue ref>

     Never bare yes/no — the gate refuses bare checkboxes. See 050-Inceptions.md
     §Disposition Gate. Bypass: --skip-disposition-gate "rationale" (direct) or
     FW_SKIP_DISPOSITION_GATE=1 (env-var, T-1890 producer/consumer parity).
-->

## Exploration Plan

<!-- How will we validate assumptions? Spikes, prototypes, research? Time-box each. -->

## Technical Constraints

<!-- What platform, browser, network, or hardware constraints apply?
     For web apps: HTTPS requirements, browser API restrictions, CORS, device support.
     For hardware APIs (mic, camera, GPS, Bluetooth): access requirements, permissions model.
     For infrastructure: network topology, firewall rules, latency bounds.
     Fill this BEFORE building. Discovering constraints after implementation wastes sessions. -->

## Scope Fence

<!-- What's IN scope for this exploration? What's explicitly OUT? -->

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
<!-- @auto-tick-on-decide -->
- [ ] Problem statement validated
<!-- @auto-tick-on-decide -->
- [ ] Assumptions tested
<!-- @auto-tick-on-decide -->
- [ ] Recommendation written with rationale

### Human
<!-- @auto-tick-on-decide -->
- [ ] [REVIEW] Review exploration findings and approve go/no-go decision
  **Steps:**
  1. Run: `fw task review T-XXX` (opens Watchtower with recommendation, assumptions, research artifacts)
  2. Review the Agent Recommendation section and go/no-go criteria evaluation
  3. Record decision via the Watchtower form or the command shown alongside the QR code
  **Expected:** Decision recorded, task completed
  **If not:** Ask agent for clarification on specific findings

## Go/No-Go Criteria

<!-- Fill these BEFORE writing the recommendation. The placeholder detector will block review/decide if left empty. -->
**GO if:**
- Root cause identified with bounded fix path
- Fix is scoped, testable, and reversible

**NO-GO if:**
- Problem requires fundamental redesign or unbounded scope
- Fix cost exceeds benefit given current evidence

## Verification

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# For inception tasks, verification is often not needed (decisions, not code).
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if a GO decision will mean editing *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml,
# *.go, Cargo.toml, tsconfig.json, or pom.xml in the build task, plan to add the
# matching build command (dotnet build / go build / cargo check / tsc --noEmit /
# mvn compile) to that build task's ## Verification — P-011 only runs what you write.

## Recommendation

**Recommendation:** GO — replace the two-stage hover with one gesture per question
(point to identify, click to read in a persistent pane).

**Rationale:** The double hover is not only a redundant gesture. Stage two is
unreliable — entering the card writes a viewport-derived `8px` into an
element positioned in document coordinates (`letzteZeile` is never assigned),
so at any real scroll position the card teleports out from under the pointer,
re-targets to a neighbouring row and collapses again. Reproduced twice
(VM-515 to VM-601, VM-503 to VM-511). When it does work, the expanded card is
868px on a 900px viewport holding 1514px of content, readable only while a
pointer is held inside it and destroyed 260ms after it leaves, with no keyboard
path at all. All four defects share one cause: hover is being used to deliver an
article. Splitting identification (hover, sticky panel) from reading (click,
persistent pane) removes them together rather than one at a time.

**Evidence:**
- `docs/reports/T-3447-struktur-double-hover.md` — full trace
- MutationObserver trace: `top 3346.7px h165 -> top 8px h868 -> top 3376.45px h185`, entity changed
- Measured: expanded card 868px / 900px viewport (96%); content 1514px in 866px box
- Keyboard focus on a row leaves `#k-mehr` hidden; click pins `#panel` but not `#karte`
- `tools/tests/test_struktur_ui.py` is green because all five card tests hover `#B-307` at low scrollY
- Target files: `/opt/1409-sprind/tools/site_build.py:1710,1757-1763,1773-1776`


## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:

     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion via: fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go --rationale "..." -->

## Updates

<!-- Auto-populated by git mining at task completion.
     Manual entries optional during execution. -->
